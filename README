I put a newer version of the gmacs hacks at the ftp site today.  The
old version is still there, renamed to something like gmacs-hacks.old.

The only changes are minor fixes:

  ;;----------------
  ;; This is version 19.25.03 of this file.
  ;; Changes since last time: 
  ;    1.  Fixed rmail-show-message-hook bug in rmail-autokill.el
  ;;   2.  jmincy@avid.com:  More hooks for comint-previous-similar-input.
  ;;   3.  jonny@Synopsys: fix to comint-previous-similar-input for 19.26
  ;;   4.  jonny@Synopsys: fix to rmail-autokill-internal for long message-id header
  ;;   5.  jmincy@avid.com:  fix automodes for c++ vs c
  ;;   6.  fixed .q automode for S
  ;;   Other misc cleanups.

No one other than me has tested the new "fixed" tar file.  So if you
try it out and I messed something up relative to the old (i.e., forgot
to include some key .el file), please let me know.

GENERIC DIRECTIONS:

	Anonymous ftp ftp.ai.mit.edu to get the file:
	   pub/users/sabot/gmacs-hacks.tar.gz
	gunzip gmacs-hacks.tar.gz to uncompress
	untar it, and look at the comments at the start of load-tmc-hacks.el

      Also, if you want me to be on the notification list when I put a new
      version at the ftp site, email me.
